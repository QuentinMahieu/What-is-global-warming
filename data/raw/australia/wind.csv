In the Kimberley, many locations saw 24 hour rainfall totals of 25-50mm with several sites receiving more than 60mm. Rainfall was lower in the Pilbara with falls generally less than 10mm. A severe gust of 96km/h was observed at Paraburdoo Aero during the afternoon, while a 91km/h gust was recorded at BHP's aerodrome at Yandi. Heavy rainfall occurred at Ellendale, southeast of Derby, with RF rates equivalent to ARI of 10-20 years (see IFD analysis).%D %D In the southern half, widespread storms occurred in the presence of a broad region of instability and high humidity. A Severe Thunderstorm Warning was issued for an area which extended from Gascoyne Junction in the north to Bridgetown in the south and east to Katanning, initially including the Perth metro area. Radar indications suggested severe cells occurred near Moora (VIL to about 50kg/m2) in the north and in the Collie region (VIL peak of 116kg/m2) in the south. Associated with the storms near the Perth suburb of Thornlie and the town of Collie were reports of 3cm hail.

Reports were received of hail to 20c piece size (~3cm diameter) with cars damaged by hailstones. Rooves were also damaged as a result of strong winds, while the anemometer at the old co-op station was snapped by a wind gust (see photo). Unfortunately, no measurements were recorded at the anemometer. There was also a report of very heavy rainfall in a 20 minute period. Unconfirmed figures are of up to 50mm in the 20min period.

Daily totals over 50 mm were reported from the 8th to the 11th, whilst at the peak of the event on a number of sites in the Lower West, including Perth and in the Great Southern recorded 24 hour totals of between 100 mm and 150 mm. Many sites recorded their highest February daily rainfall during the event. Perth Metro recorded a daily total of 114.4 mm on 10 February, its second highest daily fall for any month from records going back to 1876�behind 120.6 mm on 9 February 1992. Six-day rainfall totals from 7 to 12 February were between 150 mm and 200 mm (Figure 3), nearly 10 times the monthly average.%D %D The total rainfall at Ravensthorpe was particularly notable. It recorded 240.8 mm for February�up to the 14th�its wettest February in 116 years of record, and the highest total rainfall for any month at the site. The previous February record was 179.3 mm in 1955, and the previous record for any month was 223.2 mm in January 2000. The town of Ravensthorpe was cut-off by road from surrounding districts due to flooding as a result of the unprecedented rainfall. Daily rainfall totals in excess of 75mm are listed below.%D %D The combination of very high rainfall totals across both events brought flooding to large parts of southwest Western Australia, with major flooding reported in the Avon catchment, and minor flooding in the Swan downstream from the Avon, as well as major flooding in the Esperance Coast Basin and Blackwood River catchment.%D The flooding caused significant road damage, particularly in the Esperance Coast Basin, with the Phillips River Bridge, on the South Coast Highway to the west of the town of Ravensthorpe, destroyed. Ravensthorpe was consequently cut-off by road from surrounding districts with the Phillips River being impassable and other access roads to the town cut-off by flood waters. Two fatalities were reported as a result of two separate incidents where motor vehicles were washed off roads when trying to cross flooded rivers.",

Very high cloud bases (14,000ft on model traces) so presumably a dry downburst, but dewpoint increased from 5.7C before the peak gust to 13.0C with the peak gust so it presumably held some decent moisture so chose 'unknown' as downburst type. Damaging wind gust from a multicell system over Kintore/Wulungurru",
